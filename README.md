# **Housing, Health and Happiness: a true causality ? **

## Abstract
In Housing, Health and Happiness, Cattaneao and team set out to determine the impact of replacing dirt floors with cement floors on child health and adult happiness. We have already established that some of their results are reproductible. In the next part of the project, we seek to determine robustness of the results obtained by the authors by conducting the same analysis but using other methods. Furthermore, an additional question regarding the impact of replacing dirt floor with cement will be addressed. Namely, we will determine if the presence of cement flooring in the household, prior to the start of the study, mitigates the causality relationship previously established (cofounder).  

## Research Questions
- [ ] Do the results obtained in the paper depend on the method use ? 
- [ ] Does the presence of cement flooring prior to the study affect the causality relationshio previously established between the replacement of dirt floor with cement and child health and maternal happiness ? 

## Proposed dataset
Both datasets used here were made available by the authors of the study. We previously mentioned that we will use analysis strategies different from the ones used by the authors. In line with that approach, we will process the data differently as well (handling of missing values, comparison of houselholds through different caliper matching strategies etc). 
- *PisoFirme_AEJPol-20070024_household.dta*: dataset with information at the household level. Includes data from both the 2000 Mexican Census and the 2005 Survey. 
- *PisoFirme_AEJPol-20070024_individual.dta*: dataset with information at the individual level. Includes data from the 2005 Survey.

## Methods

## Proposed timeline
1. **By 01.12.20 :** Processing of data and caliper matching. 
2. **By 11.12.20 :** Results replication with other analysis strategies 
3. **By 15.12.20 :** Establishing the causality relationship between initial presence of cement floor, replacement of dirt floors and child health/maternal happiness. 
4. **By 18.12.20 :** Complete final report for P4 submission.
